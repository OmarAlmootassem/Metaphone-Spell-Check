/*
 * This class is the Levenshtein Distance. This algorithm checks how different
 * each word is. An example:
 * 		input = Baach
 * 		intended word = Beach
 * There is 1 error in it, so the levenshtein distance is 1. We look for words
 * that have a levenshtein distance less than 3 (a maximum of 2 errors). In a 
 * dictionary of 58 000+ words, that returns a lot of options and it does not
 * sort them accordingly. After finding the words, it calls the Metaphone method
 * to sort the words.
