Features/Limitations
1. The program uses a 58 000 word dictionary that does not includes any words that have spaces in the middle or any non alphabet characters.
2. The program uses a combination of the Levenshtein Distance algorithm and the Metaphone algorithm to find possible corrections to the incorrectly spelt words.
3. Clicking on the buttons will result in changing the word in the text area to the word on the button

KNOWN BUGS:
1. Words must be surrounded by spaces for the spell checker to work. If there is no space around the chosen word, spellcheck will NOT run.
2. Sometimes clicking multiple times on the incorrectly spelled word will cause the suggested words to get repeated. There are 2 ways to fix this:
	1.Click on another word, then click on the word again.
	2. If that doesn't fix the issue, a program restart will fix it.
